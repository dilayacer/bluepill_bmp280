I have not used PicSimLab before. I worked on gdb server between VSCode and PicSimlab. However, I couldn't. I spent a few days working on this part of the project. I did the other homework in order not to be delayed in the deadline. This week I am taking a training on netwok and cyber security. For this reason, I had the opportunity to deal with homework in the evening. I thought simple in this project. (see: Arduino :) ) But overall it was a very productive homework process for me. Thank you for everything.
